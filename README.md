# Building
### Windows
* Install [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org) using `pip3 install pyinstaller` and make it usable by adding it to environment variable (%PATH%).
* Install [aut2exe](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads) and also add it to environment variable.
* Run `build.bat` and `dist` folder will be created.
